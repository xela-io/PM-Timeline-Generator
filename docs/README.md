# Screenshots

Place your screenshots here:

- `preview.png` — Main preview image for README (recommended: 1200x630px)
- `screenshot-main.png` — Full interface screenshot
- `screenshot-timeline.png` — Timeline view detail
- `screenshot-export.png` — Export modal

## How to Create Screenshots

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Create a sample project with some phases and milestones
3. Use browser dev tools or a screenshot tool to capture
4. Recommended: Use 2x scaling for crisp images

## Tip

For the best preview image, create a timeline with:
- 2-3 groups
- 4-6 phases with different colors
- 2-3 milestones
- Some phases with buffer time
- The "today" line visible
